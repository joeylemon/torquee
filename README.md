# Torquee
A torque simulation designed to help physics students visualize the basic concept covered in most introductional physics classes.

Made with vanilla Javascript and jQuery. From-scratch canvas rendering and physics calculations.

## The Project
This was a part of the final project for EF 152 at the University of Tennessee. We were tasked with completing the follows:
- Research and define a need for a web based simulation of a physics principle
- Include at least one adjustable parameter
- Research and define the target audience
- Deliverable â€“ working app

## Our Simulation
Our simulation covered torque, including:
- Visualizations of the "force times perpendicular distance" idea
- Calculations of rotational acceleration based on the moment of inertia
- Calculations of the components of a given force based on the angle and magnitude
